# Openai-Sdk-Agent Course 

The openai-agents SDK is a new OpenAI toolkit for building multi-agent systems and complex LLM-driven workflows ‚Äî especially those involving autonomous or semi-autonomous agents that can reason, act, and collaborate using OpenAI's models.

## üß† What Is openai-agents SDK?
It is an open-source software development kit designed to help developers:

1- Build AI agents with OpenAI's models (e.g., GPT-4).

2- Orchestrate multiple agents to interact or solve tasks together.

3- Add tools (functions, APIs, or code execution) that agents can call.

4- Manage agent memory and history.

5- Stream model responses in real time.

## üîç Core Concepts
Here are the important components of the SDK:

**Agent:**	A wrapper around a language model with specific instructions and tools.

**Runner:**	Orchestrates the interaction with the agent (e.g., streaming response, history).

**Tool:**	Functions or APIs that agents can call (like search, calculator, file reader).

**RunConfig:**	Configuration object for models and tracing.

**OpenAIChatCompletionsModel:**	Wrapper around GPT-like models (can be GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, etc.).

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Can You Build With It?
Autonomous agents for law, education, customer support, etc.

1- Agentic workflows (multi-step decision-making).

2- Multi-agent collaboration (like CrewAI or AutoGen).

3- Agents that call tools, APIs, or search the web.

4- RAG systems, knowledge workers, copilots.
