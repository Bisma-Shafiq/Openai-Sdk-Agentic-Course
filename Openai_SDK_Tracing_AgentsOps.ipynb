            "\n",
            "*   **Plan:** Determine the steps needed to achieve a goal.\n",
            "*   **Act:** Execute those steps, interacting with the real world or digital environments.\n",
            "*   **Learn:** Adapt and improve their strategies based on experience and feedback.\n",
            "*   **Reason:** Make decisions and solve problems in complex situations.\n",
            "*   **Perceive:** Gather information from their environment using sensors or other data sources.\n",
            "\n",
            "Think of it like a virtual assistant that's not just following your explicit commands, but understanding your *intent* and proactively working towards achieving it, even if you haven't spelled out every single step.\n",
